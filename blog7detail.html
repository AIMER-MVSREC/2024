        <h3 dir="ltr">Custom models built with proprietary data &amp; experts</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Enterprise data is often spread across the organization in many different data stores, formats, and with varying degrees of accessibility. This data is often poorly formatted, contains inaccuracies, or is incomplete. Fine-tuned foundation models are extremely sensitive to low-quality&nbsp;data and even one example of poor data can make the difference between a model that is capable for a specific use case or is completely useless.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-64d8c924-7fff-7ef5-3942-902fcec69fb1"></strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">With Scale GenAI Platform, customers tap into Scale’s industry-leading data expertise by leveraging the Scale Data Engine to transform their proprietary data and generate the highest quality training data for their use cases. Scale then uses this training data to deliver fine-tuned models tailor-made for their unique use cases. Combined with our advanced <a href="https://scale.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-to-enhance-llms">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) tools, customers can build applications that reference and cite their knowledge base for more accurate responses.</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr">Focus on expanding to more use cases, not building infrastructure</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Enterprise customers want to get ROI from their Generative AI investments quickly, so they need to accelerate their ability to customize, build, and deploy Generative AI applications. To do this consistently across their organizations is difficult without centralized infrastructure, which is time and resource-intensive to build.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">GenAI Platform does all the heavy lifting by providing streamlined and centrally managed infrastructure to accelerate use cases into production and effortlessly scale up the number of Generative AI applications across the enterprise.</p>
        <h3><strong id="docs-internal-guid-56261a04-7fff-13a1-e312-e45d6d01b0b6">Flexibility in foundation model selection and cloud service provider</strong></h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Enterprises need the flexibility to keep up with the rapidly developing trends in Generative AI and want to avoid lock-in with a solution or provider that cannot consistently keep pace.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Some enterprises use closed-source models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Cohere’s Command model, while others opt for open-source models like Meta’s Llama 2. GenAI Platform supports all major open and closed-source foundation, embedding, and reranking models, including GPT-4 and Llama 2. We are also excited to announce that we have now added Cohere’s Command model and rerank technology to GenAI Platform for fine-tuning, inference, and use in RAG workflows.</p>

        <p>Similarly, some customers are on AWS, while others are on Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or have a multi-cloud strategy. We built GenAI Platform so our customers can securely customize and deploy enterprise-grade Generative AI Applications in their own VPC, including AWS and Azure. And we are excited to announce that we will soon be coming to the Azure Marketplace.</p>

        <h3>Test and Evaluation to maximize performance and ensure safe and responsible AI</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Like traditional software applications, organizations must test Generative AI applications to ensure they work as intended. Our customers need <a href="https://scale.com/guides/test-and-evaluation-vision">test and evaluation</a> (T&amp;E) to be confident that their models perform well and are safe and responsible. However, the tooling, processes, and human expertise for testing Generative AI applications are not widely available today.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The T&amp;E features of GenAI Platform enable our customers to be confident in their customized models with human-in-the-loop testing, evaluation, and monitoring.</p>

                <p>Similarly, some customers are on AWS, while others are on Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or have a multi-cloud strategy. We built GenAI Platform so our customers can securely customize and deploy enterprise-grade Generative AI Applications in their own VPC, including AWS and Azure. And we are excited to announce that we will soon be coming to the Azure Marketplace.</p>

                <h3>Test and Evaluation to maximize performance and ensure safe and responsible AI</h3>
                <p dir="ltr">Like traditional software applications, organizations must test Generative AI applications to ensure they work as intended. Our customers need <a href="https://scale.com/guides/test-and-evaluation-vision">test and evaluation</a> (T&amp;E) to be confident that their models perform well and are safe and responsible. However, the tooling, processes, and human expertise for testing Generative AI applications are not widely available today.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">The T&amp;E features of GenAI Platform enable our customers to be confident in their customized models with human-in-the-loop testing, evaluation, and monitoring.</p>

                <p>2023 was the year of the Generative AI POC, and we believe 2024 is the year of deploying Generative AI applications to production – delivering real business value. With Scale GenAI Platform, it is now possible to accelerate your Generative AI journey and equip your entire organization to customize, build, test, and deploy enterprise-ready Generative AI models and production applications. </p>
